# Aaliyah Bledsoe

## Course Goals

## 3 Things I Hope to Learn:
1. How to format Markdown the best way possible.
2. What is the main purpose of Markdown?
3. I want to be skilled at using Mardown.

## Potential Challeneges
- implementation of soft breaks
- organization/format
- I fear I'll lose all of my progress at some point in the course because I didn't know the process to creating a charter.md file and it's currently in a repository I just created on Github.
