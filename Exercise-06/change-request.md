# Project Change Request

## Proposed Change:
Develop a capability to embed an interactive Google Map on my webpage to display my hometown location and allows users to view details. It will require these steps:
* Research benefits and limitations of embedding Google Maps on a website.
* Generate embedded code using Google Maps.
* Make sure embedded code is compatible with current HTML structure.
* Extensive testing of embedded map to ensure it displays and functions correctly across various devices.


### Reasons for the Change:
My instructor says, "I want an embedded Google Map showing your hometown. I want to be able to see exactly where your hometown is located. An embedded Google Map will allow users to visually understand the location and interact with it."

### How This Change Will Add Value:
The proponent says, "An embedded Google Map will add a level of interactivity to your website. Users will be able to zoom in, see things nearby, and be able to see what makes your hometown special. This will make your website more engaging for users."

### How This Change Will Affect the Constraints:
#### Time
We estimate we will need to push back the project deadline by at least two days. This will allow approximately 30 minutes to an hour to embedd the Google Map and a full day of testing before pushing the final code.

#### Quality
This change will significantly improve the overall quality of the website by making it more interactive and visually appealing. The professionalism of the website will also increase.

#### Budget
This change will not impact the project budget. All of the required materials have already been acquired. Embedding an interactive Google Map will not require any additional software or subscription services.
