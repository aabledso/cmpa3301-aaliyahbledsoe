# Project Scope
I am creating a personal webpage to demonstrate the knowledge I've gained throughout the completion of my Computing Applications Degree. I also want the webpage to serve as a way for potential employers or people I've networked with to gain insight into who I am, what my qualifications are, and what I will bring to their team.
## Description
Creating my personal webpage will require me to apply all of the concepts I've learned throughout my Computing Applications courses. It will have landing, about, qualifications, interests, education, and contact pages. The webpage will provide a general oversight of who I am and my professional aspirations.
## Desired Results
* Proper use of semantic elements
* Uniform and consistent color scheme
* Organized files and lines of code
* No grammatical errors
* User-friendly interface
## Exclusions
I will not get caught up in the fancy buttons and interactive elements that have distracted me in the past. Advanced animations, JavaScript, and submission forms are out of the scope of this project. The focus will remain on completing a clean and functional webpage.
