    <h2>Computing Applications</h2>

    <p>My goals for this course are to gain a deeper understanding of computing applications and to develop practical
        skills in programming and problem-solving. I also find these courses interesting and challenging. It is fun to
        be able to see my hard work come together to form a complete project.</p>

    <p>As far as career goals go, I hope to obtain a job in the industry that involves automating manufacturing
        processes. I love working with my hands alongside some form of technology. I am interested in finding a niche
        career that allows me to travel and learn at the same time.</p>
